## Research Interest

I develop a pretty strong fascination with understanding quantum many-body problems arising in chemistry, physics, and materials science, through the lens of modern numerical computational methods or their mathematical foundations. Specifically, my current work mainly focuses on a **wide range of topics** related to **quantum physics** and **quantum chemistry**, including but not restricted to (1) electronic structure theory; (2) computational quantum many-body physics; (3) quantum algorithms for scientific computing
