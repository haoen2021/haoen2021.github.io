## Research Interest

I hope to deepen my understanding of quantum many-body problems arising from chemistry, physics, and materials science by combining **modern computational approaches** with their **mathematical foundations**. 

My current research efforts are directed toward topics such as (1) electronic structure theory, (2) open quantum systems and dissipative state engineering, and (3) scientific computing methods for many-body physics.
